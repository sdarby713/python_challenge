Edgar Odell Lovett College is the seventh-founded residential college, named after the university's first president. Lovett opened in 1969 as an all-male college, becoming co-ed in 1980 when members of the college exchanged places with the female members of Jones College. Lovett's first class mostly comprised volunteers from other colleges. Lovett sponsors numerous community and social events throughout the year, including theater productions and the Lovett Undergraduate Research Symposium. Lovett's college crest is based upon the Lovat family crest although the Lovat family is not related to Edgar Odell Lovett.
